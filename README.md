# KitchenAid Website

Welcome to the KitchenAid Website project developed by a group of three at Le Wagon!

## Overview

The KitchenAid Website is a platform designed for renting kitchen appliances, inspired by the Airbnb concept. In just one week, our team at Le Wagon crafted this Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to provide users with a user-friendly experience in renting kitchen tools and equipment.
